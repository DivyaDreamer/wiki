## Adding hosts to your CloudLAN Room
Servers feature is built for cases where you have an always-on machine/device/VM to which you would like to have a secure & private connectivity to it. The adoption process is as simple as running a single command on the server terminal. 

### When to use Server Feature?

- You want to access a machine behind router/firewalls without any port forwarding config
- Hide your device public IP address but still provide access to application running on them
- Great to setup access to Raspberry Pi boards

:::note Quick Notes
- Room should be active with a server license.
- Only Room admin can add Servers or Hosts to the room.
- Admin will be able to manage link casting on the server from user client app once connected to the room
- We currently support Ubuntu & CentOS flavors
