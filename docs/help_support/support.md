- CloudLAN vs TeamVPN, When to use what?

    **CloudLAN** is a virtual network that's provisioned for you & your team to connect & collaborate in.

    "**Connect without TeamVPN**” (OFF), all your regular internet requests will be sent through your local internet connection. This helps in better latency on VoIP or Web conferencing. Data usage will be counted as **CloudLAN Data.**

    “**Connect with TeamVPN**” (ON), all your internet traffic is securely routed through your CloudLAN room. This is useful when you are using an unknown WIFi network or want to access servers protected by firewall rules to allow only connection from whitelisted IP.
