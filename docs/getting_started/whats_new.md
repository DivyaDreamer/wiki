### v1.2 Release

### 1. Host adoption from desktop clients
<div className = "iframe_container">
    <video className="responsive-iframe" src={useBaseUrl("videos/how_to_add_host_and_adopt_windows.mp4")} title="Connecting to room" autoPlay="true" controls ></video>
</div> 

Now you can use CloudLAN desktop clients to connect non-personal devices using an integrated [Host-agent app](./hosts_intro.md). Super simple onboarding for Windows & Mac machines so all the members can securely access the device remotely over CloudLAN Device IP

### 2. Briefcase for all your links

![assets/images/bookmark.png](assets/images/bookmark.png)

[Bookmark](./bookmark.md) your servers and important links, making them centrally accessible by all members of CloudLAN room. No more digging through chats & email for the latest link of application in deployments.

## **Other Enhancements** ‚öô 

### 1. OpenVPN client Support

[Generic Client](../installation_guide/using_openvpn_clients/openvpn_clients.md) support lets you use any OpenVPN protocol supporting client for connecting [Users](../installation_guide/client_apps/generic_client.md) & [Hosts](../installation_guide/cloudlan_hosts/generic_clients.md) to your CloudLAN room.

### 2. Static PublicURL

CloudLAN's PublicURL will remain the same through start/stop casting till the service is removed. This is helpful when using PublicURL in dev environment or as webhook endpoint.


### 3. UX improvement

Following the feedback users, we have made some visual improvement & added help texts to onboard new users much faster without digging into documentation. 

### 4. Documentation

We have rewritten the [documentation](http://wiki.simply5.io) to make it more non-technical friendly. Drop-in your suggestions @ cloudlan@simply5.io
