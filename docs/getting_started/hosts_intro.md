Host feature is built for cases where you have an always-on machine/device/VM which is needed to be securely accessble by member of the room.<br /> 
The adoption process is as simple as running a single command on the server terminal. 

### When to use Hosts Feature?

- You want to access a machine behind router/firewalls without any port forwarding config
- Hide public IP address of the host but still provide access to application running on them to the team
- Great to setup anywhere access to Raspberry Pi boards

:::note Prerequisite
- Room should be active with a free Host license.
- Only Room's admin can add Hosts to the room.
- Admin will be able to manage link casting on the server from CloudLAN app once connected to the room
- We currently support Ubuntu & CentOS flavors using CloudLAN Host Agent
